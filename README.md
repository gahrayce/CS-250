Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

> A client will express their wishes for software functionality. It is the Product Owner's job to interpret the how & why of the client's needs.
> Knowing the reasoning, or how & why, behind the user's wishes helps to create an adequate Definition of Done and an accurate User Story.



Q: How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

> Planning is most effective when it can be followed with reassessment and adaptation, key features of the Scrum-Agile framework.
> I hope also to internalize from this course the importance of commmunication with & within the Scrum team.



Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

> A good team member:
> [if a developer,] fixes buggy code without consideration to whomever erred. Responsibility for the integrity of the code is every developer's job.
> attends Daily Scrums (and arrives on-time).
> communicates well.
> asks questions; seeks the guidance of P.O., S.M., developers, or testers wherever their advice may be needed.
